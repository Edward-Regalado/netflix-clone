# Netflix Clone

A clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix, built with React, Redux, Firestore, Google Authentication, and TMDB Movies API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have npm installed on your system. You can check by running the following command in your terminal: `npm -v`

## Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/netflix-clone.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd netflix-clone`

3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

4. Add a `.env` file to the root of the project with the following environment variables: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key`

5. Start the development server: `npm start`

Your browser should automatically open the app at `http://localhost:3000/`. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to that address.
